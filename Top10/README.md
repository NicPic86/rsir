- ScriptTopEvents compute the top ten events rated from users;
- ScriptTopCategories computes the top ten categories that events belong to.

These script take as input two file .txt (one that contains all the events/categories and one that contains the actual number of events/categories) and get as output one script SQL that will be used to update the tables of database.
